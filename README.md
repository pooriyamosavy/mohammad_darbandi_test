# Music App

In this mini code challenge, I have implemented every requested feature and considered every rule and limitation described in the project. To my understanding, my work is finished here, but if there was any misunderstanding or anything missing, please contact me.

## Details

1. **Page Router**: I created this Next.js app with the page router instead of the app router because of the limitations RTK has with server components and hydration. This limitation is explained in the official documentation of RTK.

2. **State Management**: Since I was not allowed to use `useState`, I had to handle the searching with a slice. This approach is not very practical in my opinion, but it was exactly what you requested.

3. **Project Structure**: The folder structure, naming conventions, and git commits are implemented for a project this small and might not be practical for a real or large project.

4. **UI/UX Design**: Since I don't think the point of this task was to test my UI/UX skills, I did not put time or effort into making a great design. I hope I'm not wrong about this.

Please let me know if any of the decisions I made conflict with what you wanted.
